    need to update any manual tests/videos? dont think so
    
ignore: start with a certain zoom instead of (1, 1), can use setZoom but bool to check if updating for setZoomMinMax is weird


---b4demo
fixed bug with zoom to fit
	*youtube video with timestamps
	*how to use worldToScreen functions
can set zoom so it will start at what the user wants
allow user to specify time of zoom to fit (0 for instant, -1 for default) 
set zoom functiuonaly and getMax and getMin zoom
restrict centre (if zooming outside bounds then continue as normal but stop movement at restrict bounds , zoom continues)
