---do?
refactor
change folder structure
ignore: need to fix attractor/repulsor??
ignore: rotation functionality
ignore: start with a certain zoom instead of (1, 1), can use setZoom but bool to check if updating for setZoomMinMax is weird
ignore: set zoom min max and it will zoom to get back to right size based on time, workaround with setZoom(getZoomMax/min)
ignore: could fix up the motion cause of the no key release


---b4demo
fixed bug with zoom to fit
	*youtube video with timestamps
	*how to use worldToScreen functions
allow user to specify time of zoom to fit (0 for instant, -1 for default) !!!Document this!!!
document that zoom to fit takes priority over deceleration but not while key pressing 
set zoom functiuonaly and getMax and getMin zoom
restrict centre (if zooming outside bounds then continue as normal but stop movement at restrict bounds , (zoom continues?))
learn keys for demo
